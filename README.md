# Heritage Quilts Photo Collection Application Profile

The Heritage Quilts Application Profile was completed in Fall 2015 for INFX 531: Metadata Design at the University of Washington, Information School. It is a METS AP which reuses PREMIS, CDWA Lite, and MIX data standards. An unrealized goal of this project was for it to provide supplementary information about the quilts in photographs, including references to quilting patterns.
